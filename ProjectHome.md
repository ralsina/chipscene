A Qt widget where you can add objects and they act according to the laws of physics (2D physics, at least).

Uses chipmunk (included), PyQt, Polygon, pymunk (included).

It supports all the features of chipmunk, I think, including but not limited to:

  * Bodies

  * Collision shapes

  * Collision callbacks

  * Joints
